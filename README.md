# User Authentication
Users are created and authenticated via AWS Cognito.

## Registration
To register for a new account, a user will provide
* Username
* Email
* Password

### Implementation
When a user registers for a new account:
* A new user is created in a User Pool on AWS Cognito; this entry 
   * sub (automatically generated by AWS Cognito)
   * username
   * email
   * password
* The creation of a new user in the User Pool then triggers an AWS Lambda function:
   * This function auto-confirms the user; the user does not need to manually confirm the registration via a confirmation email
* After the user is confirmed, another Lambda function is triggered:
   * This function adds a new entry to the 'users' table in an AWS RDS instance
   * Rationale: Allows for additional attributes to be added to users in the future (Address, Biography, etc). Also easier to fetch user details in backend queries.

## Login
An existing user will log in with:
* Username
* Password

### Implementation
When a user logs in, the username and password provided is authenticated with AWS Cognito.

If successful, a JWT token is returned and stored on Local Storage in the browser. This token is then subsequently sent in all future requests to access secured endpoints.

## After successful registration/login
A user will be redirected to the My Account Page.
