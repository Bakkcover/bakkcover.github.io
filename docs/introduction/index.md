# Introduction
Welcome to our project!

# Frontend
We chose Angular to build our user-interface with no reason in particular other than to learn yet another JavaScript\
framework.

# Backend
For our backend, we went with Spring Boot as it seems to be widely-used by enterprises for production applications.

# Deployment
We deployed our application on Amazon Web Service's cloud infrastructure, because its user interface seemed pretty fun, and fun is good.
