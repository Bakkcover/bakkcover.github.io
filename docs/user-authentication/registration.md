# Registration
To register for a new account, a user will provide:
* Username
* Email
* Password

# Implementation
When a user registers for a new account:
* A new user is created in a User Pool on AWS Cognito; this entry has the following attributes:
    * sub (a unique ID automatically generated by AWS Cognito)
    * username
    * email
    * password
* The creation of a new user in the User Pool then triggers an AWS Lambda function:
    * This function auto-confirms the user; the user does not need to manually confirm the registration via a confirmation email
* After the user is confirmed, another Lambda function is triggered:
    * This function adds a new entry to the 'users' table in an AWS RDS instance
    * Rationale:
        * Allows for additional attributes to be added to users in the future (Address, Biography, etc).
        * Allows user details to be returned in backend queries through JOIN operations.
